\title{List of changes}

\author{}

\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item The historical note is extended a bit.
\item A smooth regular plane loop and its base are defined now.
\item We changed the wording, to ensure that reader will not think that $q_1$ is uniquely defined.
\item The paragraph with ``straightforward approach'' is removed, as suggested.
\item We have added a short explanation of how to use Tait--Kneser spiral theorem to deduce the 4-vertex theorem from Theorem 4.
\item There are few minor changes as well.
\end{itemize}
